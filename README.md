# Push_swap

A sorting algorithm implementation using two stacks with specific operations to arrange a given set of integers in ascending order.

## Overview

The PushSwap program takes a stack of integers as input and sorts them using a set of predefined operations on two stacks. The goal is to manipulate the stacks efficiently to achieve a sorted order.

## Usage

Compile the Push_swap program and execute it with a list of integers to be sorted:

```
make
./push_swap 3 1 4 2
```
